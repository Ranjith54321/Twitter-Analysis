# Twitter-Analysis


    - This Simle Python Application is used to Fetch the tweets with the word "corona" and Hashtag value "corona" given date
  
    - I used  Twitter API for this functionalities
    
    - Firstly I used to store the gatheres Info in CSV formate because it is easy to read then i convert it to JSON formate
    

## Tools / Ide :

    - Spider-Annaconda
    
## Packages used :

    -  tweepy   -> twitter library for python 
    -  pandas   -> used for data handling operations
    -  cvs      -> to perform cvs file operations
    -  json     -> to perform json file operations
    -  sys      -> provides information about constants, functions and methods of the Python interpreter
    
  ## I din't get the Twitter developer account verification so I can't get the API credentials and can't show the Visual image for it
