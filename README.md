# Twitter-Analysis


    - This Simle Python Application is used to Fetch the tweets with the word "corona" and Hashtag value "corona" given date
  
    - I used  Twitter API for this functionalities
    
    - Firstly I used to store the gatheres Info in CSV formate because it is easy to read then i convert it to JSON formate
    
    
  ## I din't get the Twitter developer account verification so I can't get the API credentials and can't show the Visual image for it
