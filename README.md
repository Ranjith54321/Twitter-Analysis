# Twitter-Analysis


   - This Simple Python Application is used to Fetch the tweets with the word **corona** and Hashtag value **corona** given date
  
   - I used  Twitter API for this functionalities
    
   - Firstly I used to store the gathered Info in CSV format because it is easy to read and then I convert it to JSON format
    

## Tools / Ide :

   - Spider-Annaconda
    
## Packages used :

   -  tweepy   -> twitter library for python 
   -  pandas   -> used for data handling operations
   -  cvs      -> to perform cvs file operations
   -  json     -> to perform json file operations
   -  sys      -> provides information about constants, functions and methods of the Python interpreter
    
  ## I din't get the Twitter developer account verification so I can't get the API credentials and can't show the Visual image for it
